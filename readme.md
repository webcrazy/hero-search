# HeroSearch

Laravel Scout elasticsearch driver base on our own needs.

## What's hero-search?

Before Carro, it was car hero. Base on that, we named our elastic-scout package as hero search.
Hero search is a scout package. We created this for our own needs. Currently, this was mostly inspred via [this course](https://codecourse.com/courses/create-a-laravel-scout-elasticsearch-driver). We will keep add the features base on our needs.

## Installation

Make sure you have installed [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html)

```
$ composer install carropublic/herosearch
```

Register the provider directly in your app configuration file config/app.php config/app.php:

```php
'providers' => [
	// ...

	CarroPublic\HeroSearch\HeroSearchServiceProvider::class,
]
```

## Package Configuration

In your `.env` file, add host and port of your running elasticsearch.

```
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=your_elasticsearch_host
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=your_elasticsearch_port
```

Update scout driver to `elasticsearch` as well.
```
SCOUT_DRIVER=elasticsearch
```

## Usage example

Use scout `Searchable` trait in your model

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;

class User extends Model
{
    use Searchable;
    ...
}
```

Need to add index for your model that is needed to use scout searching
```
$ php artisan hero-search:elasticsearch:create path_to_your_model(Eg. App\\User)
```


Then import the records
```
$ php artisan scout:import path_to_your_model(Eg. App\\User)
```

You can also remove imported data by flush command:
```
$ php artisn scout:flush path_to_your_model(Eg. App\\User)
```

Add `searchableFields` methods in model to identify your query must be serached in which fields.
Eg:
```php
public function searchableFields()
{
    return [
        'name',
        'email'
    ];
}
```

Then can search by using:
```
Model::search($query)
```

Eg:
```
User::search('foo');
```
